A basic equation known to all of us, even beavers (Figure 1):

\begin{equation}
i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
\end{equation}

\textbf{Beavers, celebrated as nature's master architects, wield their construction prowess to sculpt intricate dams and lodges, not only providing shelter for their own kin but also orchestrating an ecological symphony that nurtures wetland ecosystems and fosters biodiversity.} Their remarkable role as builders and environmental stewards underscores the profound interplay between species and their habitats, exemplifying the intricate tapestry of life within our natural world.
